# Local development
There are two different folders:

-  `api` that holds files for API and
-  `admin` that holds files for administration panel.

### api
Is written in [SailsJS](https://sailsjs.com) framework.

### admin
Is written in [QuasarJS](https://quasar.dev) framework.

## Docker Compose setup
You need [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on machine.
You should run following command to run a completely Docker based local environment ready for development.

```sh
docker-compose down && docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
```

That is what you get:

 - Admin panel will be available on URL http://localhost:8080
 - API is running on URL http://localhost:1337
 - MongoDB running on default port 27017.
 - And hot reloading during both API and admin panel development.

### First boot
It might be slower due to your station configuration. Running `hot reload` feature within a Docker container can be pretty exhaustive as well as the other 2 containers that both run at the same time. So the main point is that it might take some time to start up.

## Docker volumes
Mongo DB container has a custom volume that creates itself during startup. You can see all volumes with this command:

```sh
docker volume ls
```

You can also remove all unused volumes with:

``` sh
docker volume prune -f
```

**Note:** If you delete the volume, you loose data about the cluster or nodes you previously created. So it might be useful to map your volumes to some other place.

It should all ends with the screen as follows:

![Hot Reload](/docs/images/final-screen.png "Screen")

This is a screen from Quasar CLI that indicates that app is launched on port 8080. You might ignore the red warning line.


### Change volumes
In case you remove volumes, you also lose the data you saved earlier. So it might be useful to map Mongo volume to some other location on your disk.

Open [docker-compose-dev.yml](/docker-compose-dev.yml) file and replace this line:

```yaml
volumes:
  - mongodb_data:/bitnami
```

with content like:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./my_local_db_folder:/bitnami
```

You can replace `./my_local_db_folder` with the directory you expect the Mongo will store the data.
