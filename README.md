# Mongster
Now you can easily connect your nodes with Mongo DB into one cluster within control panel. Imagine all of the options you get:
 - Control Panel for clusters with simple UI.
 - Replica sets within a few clicks.
 - Adding primary, secondary or arbiter server as well.
 - Increase / decrease priority, enable/disable voting on the Mongo.
 - Restart Docker container.
 - Create a database, manage users.

We believe the security is important. So every password or SSH key is also encrypted.

# Prerequisities
You need a latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your computer.

## Run Docker Compose

Run all Docker containers on background at once.

```sh
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

Admin panel will appear on URL http://localhost:8080

### Database
Database data directory is placed in Docker volume that is created on start up. So in case you remove all volumes you also lose data you stored into this database. So it is highly recommend to mount data directory somewhere else.

#### Change volumes
In case you remove volumes, you also lose the data you saved earlier. So it might be useful to map Mongo volume to some other location on your disk.

Open [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) file and replace this line:

```yaml
volumes:
  - mongodb_data:/bitnami
```

with content like:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./my_local_db_folder:/bitnami
```

You can replace `./my_local_db_folder` with the directory you expect the Mongo will store the data.


### Local development
You also might be interested in local development. We'll appreciate any code that will make this product just better.
